<p class="text">The Battle of Didgori (Georgian: დიდგორის ბრძოლა, romanized: didgoris brdzola) <br>
     was fought between the armies of the Kingdom of Georgia and the Seljuk Empire at the narrow place of Didgori,<br>
      40 km west of Tbilisi, on August 12, 1121.<br>
     The large Muslim army, under the command of Ilghazi,<br>
      was unable to maneuver and suffered a devastating defeat due to King David IV of Georgia's effective military tactics.</p>
