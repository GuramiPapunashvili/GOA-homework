<p class="text">Association football, commonly known as football, or soccer, is a team sport played between <br>
two teams of 11 players each, who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field <br>
called a pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving <br>
the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team.<br>
Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 <br>
minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the <br>
 world's most popular sport.</p>
